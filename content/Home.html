    <h2>Welcome to Bijou.</h2>
    <p>Bijou is an experimental template based static website generator written in .NET</p>
    <h3>Great for prototyping!</h3>
    <p>Need to get a prototype going quick and fast. You probably want to consider bijou!</p>
    <h3>Absolutely no scripting</h3>
    <p>Well, that's a double edge sword. It make things simple, however with simplicity comes limitations. Maybe the limitations are not for you, so read on...</p>
    <h3>Installation</h3>
    <p>You really only need bijou.exe (and mono if you are running this on Linux). You might want to start off with the sample content/ and templates/ folders provided with this code.</p>
    <h3>How to use it</h3>
    <p>Well, it's pretty simple. Simply run bijou.exe at the root of a folder that contains: </p> 
    <ul class='bullet'> 
      <li>content/ 
      	<ul> 
      		<li>a folder hiearchy with various content files</li>
      	</ul>
      </li>
      <li>templates/
      	<ul> 
      		<li>a folder with processing templates</li>
      	</ul>
      </li>
      <li>site/
      	<ul>
      		<li>a destination folder where the processed files are written</li>
      	</ul>
      </li>
    </ul> 
    <h3>Inspiration</h3>
    <p>I have to thank Ben Schwarz at <a href='http://tinytree.info/'>Bonsai</a> ( a PHP based version, with way more features I might add) as this is where I took a few of the ideas for this experimental project. Mucho thanks Ben! </p>
