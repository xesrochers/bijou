Welcome to Bijou
----------------
Bijou is an experimental template based static website generator written in .NET

Great for prototyping!
----------------------
Need to get a prototype going quick and fast. You probably want to consider bijou!

Absolutely no scripting
-----------------------
Well, that's a double edge sword. It make things simple, however with simplicity comes limitations. Maybe the limitations are not for you, so read on...

Installation
------------
You really only need bijou.exe (and mono if you are running this on Linux). You might want to start off with the sample content/ and templates/ folders provided with this code.

How to use it
-------------
Well, it's pretty simple. Simply run bijou.exe at the root of a folder that contains:

 - content/ 
  		(a folder hiearchy with various content files)
 - templates/
  		(a folder with processing templates)
 - site/
  		(a destination folder where the processed files are written)

Inspiration
-----------
I have to thank Ben Schwarz at http://tinytree.info/ for Bonsai ( a PHP based version, with way more features I might add) as this is where I took a few of the ideas for this experimental project. Mucho thanks Ben!
